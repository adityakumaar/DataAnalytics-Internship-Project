# DataAnalytics-Internship-Project
## This is an Exploratory Data Analysis for the customer data provided by the company.
### As an intern my tasks were to:

1. Clean the DataSet and standardise the data
2. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the DataSet
3. Analyse the results and build simple visualizations
4. Extract insights from the data and visualizations
5. Create presentation about the findings 
6. Determine the states and cities in which the company should expand its business for increasing sales and profit

*The data is mostly LikeRt values (scale data) so in my opinion the best possible visualization can be done by using BarPlots.

We have the **Customer DataSet** provided by the company.
This dataset contains only Likert and Categorical data

<b> Previous Operations Performed on The DataSet: </b> <br>
    1. Renamed all the columns <br>
    2. Standardized the data <br>
    3. Sorted the cities based on given states <br>
    4. Deleted extra columns which contained personal information of the customers <br>

<b> Operations Performed on This DataSet: </b> <br>
    1. Importing required libraries <br>
    2. General overview of the dataset <br>
    3. Visualizing data for better understanding <br>
    4. Creating an algorithm for plotting Ratings Data against Conditions <br>
    5. Visualizing data using this algorithm <br>

<b> Goal of The Project: </b> <br>
    1. To understand the data set <br>
    2. Extract some insights from it <br>
    3. Plot graphs for better understanding of the dataset <br>
    4. Select cities for the company to expand its business and get maximum profit <br>
    5. Conclude the EDA with solid reasons for expanding business in selected cities <br>
