# DataAnalytics-Internship-Project
## This is an Exploratory Data Analysis for the Customer Data Provided by the company.
### As an intern my tasks were to:

1. Clean the DataSet and standardise the data
1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the DataSet
3. Analyse the results and build simple visualizations
4. Extracting insights from the data and visualizations
5. Create presentation on the findings
6. Determine the states and cities in which the company should expand its business for increased sales and profit

*The data is mostly LikeRt values (scale sata) so in my opinion the best possible visualization is using barplots.
