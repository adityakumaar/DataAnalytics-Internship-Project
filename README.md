# DataAnalytics-Internship-Project
## This is an Exploratory Data Analysis for the customer data provided by the company.
### As an intern my tasks were to:

1. Clean the DataSet and standardise the data
1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the DataSet
3. Analyse the results and build simple visualizations
4. Extract insights from the data and visualizations
5. Create presentation about the findings 
6. Determine the states and cities in which the company should expand its business for increasing sales and profit

*The data is mostly LikeRt values (scale data) so in my opinion the best possible visualization can be done by using BarPlots.
